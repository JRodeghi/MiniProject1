      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of\r\n",
      "scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the\r\n",
      "most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very\r\n",
      "gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and\r\n",
      "emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set\r\n",
      "aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be\r\n",
      "daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and\r\n",
      "anxiety to acquire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which\r\n",
      "progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which\r\n",
      "persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu\r\n",
      "of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away\r\n",
      "traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues\r\n",
      "of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive\r\n",
      "superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The\r\n",
      "credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as\r\n",
      "powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy\r\n",
      "scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of\r\n",
      "conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.\r\n",
      "History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent\r\n",
      "times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the\r\n",
      "indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are\r\n",
      "jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an\r\n",
      "ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.\r\n",
      "Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this\r\n",
      "troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is\r\n",
      "sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its\r\n",
      "demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere\r\n",
      "facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,\r\n",
      "is the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical\r\n",
      "characters can only be estimated by the standard which human\r\n",
      "experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form\r\n",
      "correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a\r\n",
      "great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of\r\n",
      "beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents\r\n",
      "in their lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we\r\n",
      "must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than\r\n",
      "the respective probability of its details.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know\r\n",
      "least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere[1] have, perhaps,\r\n",
      "contributed more to the intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any\r\n",
      "other three writers who could be named, and yet the history of all\r\n",
      "three has given rise to a boundless ocean of discussion, which has left\r\n",
      "us little save the option of choosing which theory or theories we will\r\n",
      "follow. The personality of Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in\r\n",
      "which critics will allow us to believe without controversy; but upon\r\n",
      "everything else, even down to the authorship of plays, there is more or\r\n",
      "less of doubt and uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the\r\n",
      "contradictions of Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one\r\n",
      "of the _dramatis personæ_ in two dramas as unlike in principles as in\r\n",
      "style. He appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their\r\n",
      "tone as those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have\r\n",
      "read Plato _or_ Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when\r\n",
      "we have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are\r\n",
      "something worse than ignorant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny\r\n",
      "the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and\r\n",
      "condition were too much for our belief. This system—which has often\r\n",
      "comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of\r\n",
      "Strauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value\r\n",
      "to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To\r\n",
      "question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more\r\n",
      "excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact\r\n",
      "related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory\r\n",
      "developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in\r\n",
      "the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured\r\n",
      "old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—_Numa\r\n",
      "Pompilius._\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,\r\n",
      "and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free\r\n",
      "permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard all\r\n",
      "written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and\r\n",
      "Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily\r\n",
      "dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. “This\r\n",
      "cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because\r\n",
      "it cannot be true.” Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon\r\n",
      "testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and\r\n",
      "oblivion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are\r\n",
      "partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which\r\n",
      "truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of\r\n",
      "the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken\r\n",
      "of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to\r\n",
      "Herodotus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "According to this document, the city of Cumæ in Æolia, was, at an\r\n",
      "early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of\r\n",
      "Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.\r\n",
      "Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named\r\n",
      "Critheïs. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the\r\n",
      "guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this\r\n",
      "maiden that we “are indebted for so much happiness.” Homer was the\r\n",
      "first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of\r\n",
      "Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Bœotia,\r\n",
      "whither Critheïs had been transported in order to save her reputation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At this time,” continues our narrative, “there lived at Smyrna a man\r\n",
      "named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being\r\n",
      "married, engaged Critheïs to manage his household, and spin the flax he\r\n",
      "received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was\r\n",
      "her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made\r\n",
      "proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,\r\n",
      "willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,\r\n",
      "if he were carefully brought up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature\r\n",
      "had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every\r\n",
      "attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius\r\n",
      "died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon\r\n",
      "followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father’s school with great\r\n",
      "success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,\r\n",
      "but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially\r\n",
      "in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these\r\n",
      "visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who\r\n",
      "evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,\r\n",
      "persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his\r\n",
      "travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him\r\n",
      "with a further stipend, urging, that, “While he was yet young, it was\r\n",
      "fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities\r\n",
      "which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses.” Melesigenes\r\n",
      "consented, and set out with his patron, “examining all the curiosities\r\n",
      "of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by\r\n",
      "interrogating those whom he met.” We may also suppose, that he wrote\r\n",
      "memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation.[2] Having set\r\n",
      "sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached Ithaca. Here Melesigenes,\r\n",
      "who had already suffered in his eyes, became much worse, and Mentes,\r\n",
      "who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him to the medical\r\n",
      "superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the son of Alcinor.\r\n",
      "Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes rapidly became\r\n",
      "acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which afterwards formed\r\n",
      "the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca assert, that it\r\n",
      "was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the Colophomans make their\r\n",
      "city the seat of that misfortune. He then returned to Smyrna, where he\r\n",
      "applied himself to the study of poetry.[3]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But poverty soon drove him to Cumæ. Having passed over the Hermæan\r\n",
      "plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumæ.\r\n",
      "Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of\r\n",
      "one Tychias, an armourer. “And up to my time,” continued the author,\r\n",
      "“the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a\r\n",
      "recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also\r\n",
      "a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes\r\n",
      "arrived”.[4]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being\r\n",
      "the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph\r\n",
      "on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater\r\n",
      "probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.[5]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Arrived at Cumæ, he frequented the _converzationes_[6] of the old men,\r\n",
      "and delighted all by the charms of his poetry. Encouraged by this\r\n",
      "favourable reception, he declared that, if they would allow him a\r\n",
      "public maintenance, he would render their city most gloriously\r\n",
      "renowned. They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure\r\n",
      "he proposed, and procured him an audience in the council. Having made\r\n",
      "the speech, with the purport of which our author has forgotten to\r\n",
      "acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate respecting the answer\r\n",
      "to be given to his proposal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet’s\r\n",
      "demand, but one man observed that “if they were to feed _Homers_, they\r\n",
      "would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people.” “From this\r\n",
      "circumstance,” says the writer, “Melesigenes acquired the name of\r\n",
      "Homer, for the Cumans call blind men _Homers_.”[7] With a love of\r\n",
      "economy, which shows how similar the world has always been in its\r\n",
      "treatment of literary men, the pension was denied, and the poet vented\r\n",
      "his disappointment in a wish that Cumæa might never produce a poet\r\n",
      "capable of giving it renown and glory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Phocœa, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.\r\n",
      "One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept\r\n",
      "Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the\r\n",
      "verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient\r\n",
      "poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary\r\n",
      "publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.\r\n",
      "At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: “O Thestorides, of\r\n",
      "the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more\r\n",
      "unintelligible than the human heart.”[8]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian\r\n",
      "merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him\r\n",
      "recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a\r\n",
      "profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at\r\n",
      "once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be\r\n",
      "setting sail thither, but he found one ready to start for Erythræ, a\r\n",
      "town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the\r\n",
      "seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a\r\n",
      "favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the\r\n",
      "imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn\r\n",
      "down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Erythræ, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in\r\n",
      "Phocœa, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,\r\n",
      "reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,\r\n",
      "which we will continue in the words of our author. “Having set out from\r\n",
      "Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were\r\n",
      "pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus\r\n",
      "(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up\r\n",
      "quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For some\r\n",
      "time he stood wondering how a blind man should have reached such a\r\n",
      "place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to\r\n",
      "him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places\r\n",
      "and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting\r\n",
      "to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;\r\n",
      "and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade\r\n",
      "him sup.[9]\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according\r\n",
      "to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O\r\n",
      "Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs\r\n",
      "their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,\r\n",
      "whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author.\r\n",
      "Having finished supper, they banqueted[10] afresh on conversation,\r\n",
      "Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities he had\r\n",
      "visited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus\r\n",
      "resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with\r\n",
      "Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left\r\n",
      "Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,\r\n",
      "a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole\r\n",
      "story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to\r\n",
      "what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and\r\n",
      "feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the\r\n",
      "stranger to him.\r\n",

      "written Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was\r\n",
      "not only planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings,\r\n",
      "and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of\r\n",
      "voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for\r\n",
      "emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never\r\n",
      "reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive\r\n",
      "it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn\r\n",
      "and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would\r\n",
      "be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of\r\n",
      "readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had\r\n",

      "written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the\r\n",
      "impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may\r\n",
      "seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and\r\n",
      "there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.\r\n",

      "of the seventh century before the Christian æra (B.C. 660 to B.C.\r\n",
      "630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonidês of\r\n",
      "Amorgus, &c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in\r\n",
      "the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac\r\n",

      "primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred\r\n",

      "United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing\r\n",
      "around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a\r\n",
      "spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the\r\n",
      "mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides\r\n",
      "which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and\r\n",
      "was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,\r\n",
      "and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely\r\n",
      "recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,\r\n",
      "probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the\r\n",
      "memory considerably.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a\r\n",
      "poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Mœonides, but most\r\n",
      "probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great\r\n",
      "utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of\r\n",

      "which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic\r\n",
      "dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He\r\n",
      "therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is\r\n",

      "all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand\r\n",
      "too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully\r\n",
      "appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has\r\n",

      "violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with\r\n",
      "love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author\r\n",

      "on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which\r\n",

      "disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive\r\n",
      "deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his\r\n",
      "whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a\r\n",
      "translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,\r\n",
      "which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical\r\n",
      "attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it\r\n",
      "is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the\r\n",
      "contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a\r\n",
      "perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called\r\n",
      "literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something\r\n",
      "like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of\r\n",
      "a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing\r\n",
      "fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the\r\n",
      "poet’s meaning, his _words_ were less jealously sought for, and those\r\n",

      "satisfied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope’s translation by our own\r\n",

      "writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested\r\n",
      "with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular\r\n",
      "excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a\r\n",
      "wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most\r\n",
      "excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the\r\n",
      "invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:\r\n",
      "the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which\r\n",
      "masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art\r\n",
      "with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but\r\n",
      "“steal wisely:” for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on\r\n",
      "managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works\r\n",
      "of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the\r\n",
      "invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can\r\n",
      "only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,\r\n",
      "which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more\r\n",
      "entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are\r\n",
      "inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and\r\n",
      "fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue\r\n",
      "their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to\r\n",
      "comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Our author’s work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the\r\n",
      "beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the\r\n",
      "number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,\r\n",
      "which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of\r\n",
      "which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,\r\n",
      "each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things\r\n",
      "are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if\r\n",

      "man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.\r\n",
      "What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing\r\n",
      "moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,\r\n",
      "or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said or\r\n",
      "done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by\r\n",

      "or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even\r\n",

      "absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing\r\n",

      "as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but\r\n",
      "everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in\r\n",
      "sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a\r\n",
      "furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in\r\n",

      "compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward\r\n",
      "passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all\r\n",
      "the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but\r\n",
      "wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and\r\n",
      "boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in\r\n",
      "the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls “the soul of\r\n",
      "poetry,” was first breathed into it by Homer. I shall begin with\r\n",
      "considering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak\r\n",
      "of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the\r\n",
      "marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,\r\n",
      "though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;\r\n",
      "or of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional\r\n",
      "episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of\r\n",
      "an epic poem, “The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in\r\n",
      "Italy,” or the like. That of the Iliad is the “anger of Achilles,” the\r\n",
      "most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet\r\n",
      "this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents and events, and\r\n",
      "crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and\r\n",
      "episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose\r\n",
      "schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is\r\n",
      "hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration\r\n",
      "employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a\r\n",
      "genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as\r\n",
      "a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer’s\r\n",
      "poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The\r\n",
      "other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it\r\n",
      "so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of\r\n",
      "action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor\r\n",
      "is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his\r\n",
      "invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of\r\n",
      "story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up\r\n",
      "their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,\r\n",
      "Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)\r\n",
      "destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses\r\n",
      "visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent\r\n",
      "after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of\r\n",
      "Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be\r\n",
      "absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,\r\n",
      "Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he\r\n",
      "gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the\r\n",
      "same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close\r\n",
      "imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the\r\n",
      "want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking\r\n",
      "of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from\r\n",
      "Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea\r\n",

      "Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could\r\n",
      "have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by\r\n",
      "their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has\r\n",
      "observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single\r\n",
      "quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters\r\n",
      "of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of\r\n",
      "Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that\r\n",
      "of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:\r\n",
      "the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;\r\n",
      "that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we\r\n",
      "find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and\r\n",
      "generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be\r\n",
      "found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each\r\n",
      "character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to\r\n",
      "give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters\r\n",
      "of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,\r\n",
      "that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,\r\n",
      "open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and\r\n",
      "this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of\r\n",
      "his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other\r\n",
      "upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these\r\n",
      "kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open\r\n",
      "manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,\r\n",
      "where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to\r\n",
      "those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of\r\n",
      "Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and\r\n",
      "we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of\r\n",
      "Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest. In like manner it may be remarked of\r\n",
      "Statius’s heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the\r\n",
      "same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,\r\n",
      "Hippomedon, &c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem\r\n",
      "brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this\r\n",
      "tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic\r\n",
      "writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,\r\n",
      "the invention of Homer was to that of all others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;\r\n",
      "being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,\r\n",
      "of those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the\r\n",
      "Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. “Everything in\r\n",
      "it has manner” (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is\r\n",
      "acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how\r\n",
      "small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the\r\n",
      "dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches\r\n",
      "often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be\r\n",
      "equally just in any person’s mouth upon the same occasion. As many of\r\n",
      "his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape\r\n",
      "being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of\r\n",
      "the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in\r\n",
      "Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests\r\n",
      "us less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil\r\n",

      "If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same\r\n",
      "presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his\r\n",
      "thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part\r\n",
      "Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the\r\n",
      "grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they\r\n",
      "have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his\r\n",
      "Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort.\r\n",
      "And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if\r\n",
      "Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so\r\n",
      "many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises\r\n",
      "into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the\r\n",
      "invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast\r\n",
      "comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance\r\n",
      "of art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and\r\n",
      "fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various\r\n",
      "views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions\r\n",
      "taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full\r\n",
      "prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side\r\n",
      "views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as\r\n",
      "the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the\r\n",
      "Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no\r\n",
      "one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that\r\n",
      "no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of\r\n",
      "noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,\r\n",
      "horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of\r\n",
      "images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted\r\n",
      "himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil\r\n",
      "especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright\r\n",
      "imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We\r\n",
      "acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught\r\n",
      "that “language of the gods” to men. His expression is like the\r\n",
      "colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on\r\n",
      "boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and\r\n",
      "most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.\r\n",
      "Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out\r\n",
      "“living words;” there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than\r\n",
      "in any good author whatever. An arrow is “impatient” to be on the wing,\r\n",
      "a weapon “thirsts” to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet\r\n",
      "his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in\r\n",
      "proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the\r\n",
      "diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the\r\n",
      "same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,\r\n",
      "as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass\r\n",
      "in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a\r\n",

      "To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected\r\n",
      "the compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper\r\n",
      "to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted\r\n",
      "and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise\r\n",
      "conduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last\r\n",
      "consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of\r\n",
      "his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of\r\n",
      "supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were\r\n",
      "joined. We see the motion of Hector’s plumes in the epithet\r\n",
      "Κορυθαίολος, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Εἰνοσίφυλλος,\r\n",
      "and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted\r\n",
      "upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a\r\n",
      "single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal\r\n",
      "action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these\r\n",
      "epithets is a short description.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a\r\n",
      "share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not\r\n",
      "satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of\r\n",
      "Greece, but searched through its different dialects with this\r\n",
      "particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered\r\n",
      "these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and\r\n",
      "accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater\r\n",
      "smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has\r\n",
      "a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its\r\n",
      "custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make\r\n",
      "the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.\r\n",
      "With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the\r\n",
      "feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its\r\n",
      "accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the\r\n",
      "licence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his\r\n",
      "sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his\r\n",
      "rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in\r\n",
      "the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all\r\n",
      "these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not\r\n",
      "only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so\r\n",
      "great a truth, that whoever will but consult the tune of his verses,\r\n",
      "even without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we\r\n",
      "daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more\r\n",
      "sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of\r\n",
      "poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be\r\n",
      "copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to\r\n",
      "ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some\r\n",
      "advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and\r\n",
      "cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.\r\n",
      "Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in\r\n",
      "working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was\r\n",
      "capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his\r\n",
      "line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has\r\n",
      "not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the\r\n",
      "only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than\r\n",
      "the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our\r\n",
      "author’s beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of\r\n",
      "Words. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow\r\n",
      "with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than\r\n",
      "to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,\r\n",
      "with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise\r\n",
      "us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river,\r\n",
      "always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of\r\n",
      "verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us\r\n",
      "is his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of\r\n",
      "his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more\r\n",
      "extensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and\r\n",
      "strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his\r\n",
      "sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full\r\n",
      "and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers\r\n",
      "more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with\r\n",
      "regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his\r\n",
      "character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of\r\n",
      "comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in\r\n",
      "them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.\r\n",
      "We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and\r\n",
      "distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider\r\n",
      "him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No\r\n",
      "author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and\r\n",
      "as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that\r\n",
      "we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a\r\n",
      "more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer\r\n",
      "possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of\r\n",
      "both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in\r\n",
      "comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the\r\n",
      "better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.\r\n",
      "Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil\r\n",
      "leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous\r\n",
      "profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the\r\n",
      "Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a\r\n",
      "river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold\r\n",
      "their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they\r\n",
      "celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all\r\n",
      "before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,\r\n",
      "calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the\r\n",
      "action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And\r\n",
      "when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in\r\n",
      "his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the\r\n",
      "heavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling\r\n",
      "with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his\r\n",
      "whole creation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they\r\n",
      "naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to\r\n",
      "distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As\r\n",
      "prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment\r\n",
      "decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or\r\n",
      "extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we\r\n",
      "look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections\r\n",
      "against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this\r\n",
      "faculty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which\r\n",
      "so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of\r\n",
      "probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with\r\n",
      "gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,\r\n",
      "exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become\r\n",
      "miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit\r\n",
      "something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable\r\n",
      "performances. Thus Homer has his “speaking horses;” and Virgil his\r\n",
      "“myrtles distilling blood;” where the latter has not so much as\r\n",
      "contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been\r\n",
      "thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this\r\n",
      "faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine\r\n",
      "itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is\r\n",
      "grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,\r\n",
      "however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes\r\n",
      "are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its\r\n",
      "proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with\r\n",
      "occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his\r\n",
      "manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when\r\n",
      "his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent\r\n",
      "images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more\r\n",
      "objections of the same kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or\r\n",
      "narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will\r\n",
      "be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the\r\n",
      "times he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods;\r\n",
      "and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here\r\n",
      "speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into\r\n",
      "extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a\r\n",
      "strange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,[38] “that\r\n",
      "those times and manners are so much the more excellent, as they are\r\n",
      "more contrary to ours.” Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to\r\n",
      "magnify the felicity of those ages, when a spirit of revenge and\r\n",
      "cruelty, joined with the practice of rapine and robbery, reigned\r\n",
      "through the world: when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre;\r\n",
      "when the greatest princes were put to the sword, and their wives and\r\n",
      "daughters made slaves and concubines? On the other side, I would not be\r\n",
      "so delicate as those modern critics, who are shocked at the servile\r\n",
      "offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of\r\n",
      "Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity,\r\n",
      "in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs\r\n",
      "without their guards; princes tending their flocks, and princesses\r\n",
      "drawing water from the springs. When we read Homer, we ought to reflect\r\n",
      "that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world; and\r\n",
      "those who consider him in this light, will double their pleasure in the\r\n",
      "perusal of him. Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations\r\n",
      "and people that are now no more; that they are stepping almost three\r\n",
      "thousand years back into the remotest antiquity, and entertaining\r\n",
      "themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to\r\n",
      "be found, the only true mirror of that ancient world. By this means\r\n",
      "alone their greatest obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates\r\n",
      "their dislike, will become a satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of\r\n",
      "the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the “far-darting\r\n",
      "Phœbus,” the “blue-eyed Pallas,” the “swift-footed Achilles,” &c.,\r\n",
      "which some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those\r\n",
      "of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to\r\n",
      "belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the\r\n",
      "rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of\r\n",
      "attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all\r\n",
      "occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets\r\n",
      "of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature\r\n",
      "of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names\r\n",
      "derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction\r\n",
      "of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of\r\n",
      "birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,\r\n",
      "Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &c. Homer, therefore,\r\n",
      "complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive\r\n",
      "additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something\r\n",
      "parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold\r\n",
      "Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,\r\n",
      "&c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for\r\n",
      "the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the\r\n",
      "world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the\r\n",
      "brazen and the iron one, of “heroes distinct from other men; a divine\r\n",
      "race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by\r\n",
      "the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed.”[39] Now among the\r\n",
      "divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in\r\n",
      "common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an\r\n",
      "epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their\r\n",
      "families, actions or qualities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly\r\n",

      "would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these\r\n",
      "critics never so much as heard of Homer’s having written first; a\r\n",
      "consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have\r\n",

      "overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and\r\n",
      "moral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which\r\n",
      "might set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser man,\r\n",
      "and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of\r\n",
      "the other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed;\r\n",

      "those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some\r\n",
      "that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole management of Scaliger\r\n",
      "in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean\r\n",
      "expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement, oftener\r\n",
      "from an ignorance of the graces of the original, and then triumph in\r\n",
      "the awkwardness of their own translations: this is the conduct of\r\n",
      "Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly, there are others, who, pretending to\r\n",
      "a fairer proceeding, distinguish between the personal merit of Homer,\r\n",
      "and that of his work; but when they come to assign the causes of the\r\n",
      "great reputation of the Iliad, they found it upon the ignorance of his\r\n",
      "times, and the prejudice of those that followed; and in pursuance of\r\n",
      "this principle, they make those accidents (such as the contention of\r\n",
      "the cities, &c.) to be the causes of his fame, which were in reality\r\n",
      "the consequences of his merit. The same might as well be said of\r\n",
      "Virgil, or any great author whose general character will infallibly\r\n",
      "raise many casual additions to their reputation. This is the method of\r\n",
      "Mons. de la Mott; who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age\r\n",

      "In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to\r\n",
      "the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed\r\n",
      "the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his\r\n",
      "followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may\r\n",
      "commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of\r\n",
      "critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most\r\n",
      "universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the\r\n",
      "strongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry,\r\n",
      "but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has\r\n",
      "swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done\r\n",
      "admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation.\r\n",
      "He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in\r\n",
      "some of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work\r\n",
      "of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most\r\n",
      "vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the\r\n",
      "finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit\r\n",
      "join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have\r\n",
      "only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of\r\n",
      "nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.\r\n",

      "Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it\r\n",
      "remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief\r\n",
      "characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,\r\n",
      "such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice\r\n",
      "it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in\r\n",
      "every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too\r\n",
      "much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the\r\n",
      "first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and\r\n",
      "unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his\r\n",
      "proper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to\r\n",

      "language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that\r\n",

      "less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the\r\n",
      "modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there\r\n",
      "is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a\r\n",
      "version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but\r\n",
      "those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,\r\n",
      "and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will\r\n",
      "venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by\r\n",
      "a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours\r\n",
      "by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.\r\n",
      "It is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator\r\n",
      "should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his\r\n",
      "managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving\r\n",
      "this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than\r\n",
      "he finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret\r\n",
      "in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;\r\n",
      "and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in\r\n",
      "his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours\r\n",
      "as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to\r\n",
      "be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of\r\n",
      "a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer seems to have been\r\n",
      "more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his\r\n",
      "translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the\r\n",
      "sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of\r\n",
      "simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some\r\n",
      "sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the\r\n",
      "certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in\r\n",
      "his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an\r\n",
      "unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes\r\n",
      "one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be\r\n",
      "envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of\r\n",
      "style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and\r\n",
      "the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and\r\n",
      "dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as\r\n",
      "much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:\r\n",
      "it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.\r\n",
      "Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the\r\n",
      "Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the\r\n",
      "inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words\r\n",
      "but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that\r\n",
      "part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his\r\n",
      "style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books\r\n",
      "than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what\r\n",
      "has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,\r\n",
      "induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those\r\n",
      "general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a\r\n",
      "veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;\r\n",
      "as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the\r\n",
      "Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care\r\n",
      "should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and\r\n",
      "proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have\r\n",
      "something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned\r\n",
      "gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which\r\n",
      "would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more\r\n",
      "ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Perhaps the mixture of some Græcisms and old words after the manner of\r\n",
      "Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill\r\n",
      "effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other\r\n",
      "seems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of\r\n",
      "modern terms of war and government, such as “platoon, campaign, junto,”\r\n",
      "or the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There are two peculiarities in Homer’s diction, which are a sort of\r\n",
      "marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first\r\n",
      "sight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as\r\n",
      "defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I\r\n",
      "speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the\r\n",
      "former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the\r\n",
      "purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide\r\n",
      "easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the\r\n",
      "ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which\r\n",
      "have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are\r\n",
      "become familiar through their use of them; such as “the\r\n",
      "cloud-compelling Jove,” &c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as\r\n",
      "fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded\r\n",
      "one, the course to be taken is obvious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one\r\n",
      "or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the\r\n",
      "epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous\r\n",
      "translated literally “leaf-shaking,” but affords a majestic idea in the\r\n",
      "periphrasis: “the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods.” Others that\r\n",
      "admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a\r\n",
      "judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are\r\n",
      "introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, ἑκηβόλος or\r\n",
      "“far-shooting,” is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect\r\n",
      "of the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical,\r\n",
      "with regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where\r\n",
      "Apollo is represented as a god in person, I would use the former\r\n",
      "interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would\r\n",
      "make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to\r\n",
      "avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in\r\n",
      "Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already\r\n",
      "shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one\r\n",
      "may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an\r\n",
      "additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in\r\n",
      "doing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his\r\n",
      "judgment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Homer’s repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of\r\n",
      "whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or\r\n",
      "hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,\r\n",
      "as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor\r\n",
      "to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not\r\n",
      "ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders\r\n",
      "it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods\r\n",
      "to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or\r\n",
      "where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn\r\n",
      "forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the\r\n",
      "best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the\r\n",
      "repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one\r\n",
      "may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed\r\n",
      "translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is\r\n",
      "to answer for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)\r\n",
      "is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every\r\n",
      "new subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of\r\n",
      "poetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it\r\n",
      "in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may\r\n",
      "sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully possessed\r\n",
      "of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed\r\n",
      "this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to\r\n",
      "all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who\r\n",
      "have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing\r\n",
      "justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may\r\n",
      "entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him\r\n",
      "than any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those\r\n",
      "of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an\r\n",
      "immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce\r\n",
      "any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent\r\n",
      "interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the\r\n",
      "thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty\r\n",
      "verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one\r\n",
      "might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of\r\n",
      "his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a\r\n",
      "strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;\r\n",
      "insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries\r\n",
      "he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the\r\n",
      "obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a\r\n",
      "fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the\r\n",
      "tragedy of Bussy d’Amboise, &c. In a word, the nature of the man may\r\n",
      "account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and\r\n",
      "remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.\r\n",
      "His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen\r\n",
      "weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that\r\n",
      "which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover\r\n",
      "his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation,\r\n",
      "which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have\r\n",
      "writ before he arrived at years of discretion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but\r\n",
      "for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often\r\n",
      "omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close\r\n",
      "translation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the\r\n",
      "shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original\r\n",
      "line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes\r\n",
      "omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of\r\n",
      "mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but\r\n",
      "through carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby’s, is too mean for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live\r\n",
      "to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small\r\n",
      "part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly\r\n",
      "interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be\r\n",
      "excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to\r\n",
      "have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies,\r\n",
      "and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the\r\n",
      "original. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more\r\n",
      "have attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom\r\n",
      "(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited\r\n",
      "translation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is\r\n",
      "like that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in\r\n",

      "sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as\r\n",
      "most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of\r\n",
      "his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,\r\n",
      "in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the\r\n",
      "more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a\r\n",
      "fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not\r\n",
      "to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor\r\n",
      "sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound\r\n",
      "any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the\r\n",
      "whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any\r\n",
      "translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What\r\n",
      "I would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from\r\n",
      "his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or\r\n",
      "whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to\r\n",
      "consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the\r\n",
      "ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the\r\n",
      "Archbishop of Cambray’s Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the\r\n",
      "spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu’s admirable Treatise of the\r\n",

      "those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning.\r\n",
      "For to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this\r\n",

      "guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and\r\n",
      "by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be\r\n",
      "true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men\r\n",

      "The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector,\r\n",
      "Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her\r\n",
      "descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scæan gate. They agree to put\r\n",
      "off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge\r\n",
      "the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the\r\n",
      "challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after\r\n",
      "several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a\r\n",
      "council, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which\r\n",
      "Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam\r\n",
      "sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning\r\n",
      "the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the\r\n",
      "funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,\r\n",
      "erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with\r\n",
      "towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his\r\n",
      "jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both\r\n",
      "armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans\r\n",
      "with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.\r\n",
      "    The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax,\r\n",

      "Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,\r\n",
      "Nor aught the warrior’s thundering mace avail’d.\r\n",
      "Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before\r\n",

      "But when old age had dimm’d Lycurgus’ eyes,\r\n",
      "To Ereuthalion he consign’d the prize.\r\n",

      "Till I, the youngest of the host, appear’d,\r\n",
      "And, youngest, met whom all our army fear’d.\r\n",
      "I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown’d:\r\n",

      "The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:\r\n",
      "Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear’d;\r\n",
      "And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear’d;\r\n",
      "Oïleus follow’d; Idomen was there,[180]\r\n",
      "And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:\r\n",
      "With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,\r\n",
      "And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.\r\n",

      "His corslet enters, and his garment rends,\r\n",
      "And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.\r\n",

      "With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,\r\n",
      "And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,\r\n",
      "The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown’d.\r\n",
      "As the scorch’d locusts from their fields retire,\r\n",
      "While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;\r\n",
      "Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,\r\n",
      "The clustering legions rush into the flood:\r\n",
      "So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles’ force,\r\n",
      "Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.\r\n",
      "His bloody lance the hero casts aside,\r\n",

      "Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,\r\n",
      "Deep groan’d the waters with the dying sound;\r\n",

      "Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;\r\n",
      "With their rich belts their captive arms restrains\r\n",
      "(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).\r\n",
      "These his attendants to the ships convey’d,\r\n",
      "Sad victims destined to Patroclus’ shade;\r\n",

      "But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,\r\n",
      "The ransom’d prince to fair Arisbe bore.\r\n",
      "Ten days were past, since in his father’s reign\r\n",

      "His useless lance and unavailing shield,)\r\n",

      "And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!\r\n",

      "And his soul shivering at the approach of death.\r\n",
      "Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;\r\n",
      "He kiss’d his feet, extended on the ground:\r\n",
      "And while, above, the spear suspended stood,\r\n",
      "Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,\r\n",

      "    peculiar and difficult situations, and to extricate himself from\r\n",
      "    them with the completest success. The whole scene between Achilles\r\n",
      "    and Priam, when the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose\r\n",
      "    of redeeming the body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly\r\n",
      "    skilful, and yet the simplest and most affecting passage in the\r\n",
      "    Iliad. Quinctilian has taken notice of the following speech of\r\n",
      "    Priam, the rhetorical artifice of which is so transcendent, that if\r\n",
      "    genius did not often, especially in oratory, unconsciously fulfil\r\n",
      "    the most subtle precepts of criticism, we might be induced, on this\r\n",

      "    Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his father; in\r\n",
      "    gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation; and,\r\n",

      "    softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of\r\n",
      "    the conqueror. The ego d’eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha\r\n",
      "    geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the\r\n",

      "    name, but which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can\r\n",

      " vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated by\r\n",

      " made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of the\r\n",
      " body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites\r\n",
      " essential to the soul’s admission into the more favoured regions of\r\n",
      " the lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary\r\n",
